# Telegram to SMS Forwarder

A service that forwards your Telegram messages to SMS, allowing you to stay connected even when you don't have internet access.

## ðŸš¨ Important Safety Features ðŸš¨

To prevent excessive SMS sending and protect your SMS balance, this application includes several safety features:

1. **Muted Chat Filtering**: By default, messages from muted chats are not forwarded. This prevents unwanted messages from draining your SMS balance.

2. **Rate Limiting**: The application includes a rate limiter that restricts the number of SMS messages that can be sent in a given time period:
   - Global limit: 10 messages per hour by default
   - Per-chat limit: 3 messages per hour from any single chat by default
   - These limits can be adjusted in the Settings page

3. **Configurable Forwarding**: You can configure which types of messages are forwarded:
   - Option to only forward messages from non-muted chats
   - Option to include or exclude media messages
   - Option to include or exclude your own messages

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Create a `.env` file with your Telegram API credentials:
   ```
   TELEGRAM_API_ID=your_api_id
   TELEGRAM_API_HASH=your_api_hash
   SMSC_LOGIN=your_smsc_login
   SMSC_PASSWORD=your_smsc_password
   ```
4. Run the web application: `python web_app.py`
5. Open the web interface at http://127.0.0.1:5001
6. Log in with your Telegram account
7. Set your phone number in the Settings page
8. Start the forwarder from the Dashboard

## Usage

1. **Dashboard**: View the status of the forwarder and recent messages
2. **Settings**: Configure the forwarder settings, including:
   - Forwarding options (all chats, non-muted chats, media messages, own messages)
   - Rate limiting settings (maximum messages per hour, per chat)
   - SMS settings (maximum SMS length)
3. **Start/Stop Forwarding**: Use the buttons on the Dashboard to start or stop the forwarder

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the forwarder:

1. Check the logs in `app.log` and `debug_output.txt`
2. Verify your SMS provider credentials
3. Make sure your Telegram session is valid
4. Check the rate limiting settings if messages are not being forwarded
