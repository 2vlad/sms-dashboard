# Message Summary Feature

## Overview
The Message Summary feature provides a standalone, mobile-first page that displays a summary of the 10 most recent Telegram messages. This feature is designed for quick scanning of recent communications, with a focus on readability and simplicity.

## Features
- Shows up to 10 recent messages from Telegram chats
- Groups messages by chat for cleaner presentation
- Numbers multiple messages from the same channel/chat
- Automatic refresh every 30 seconds to show latest messages
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Dedicated logout button

## Technical Implementation
The feature consists of:
1. A new route in `web_app.py` to serve the summary page
2. A REST API endpoint to refresh summary data via AJAX
3. A custom template with mobile-first design
4. Custom CSS with specified fonts and styling
5. JavaScript to handle the auto-refresh functionality

## Design Specifications
- Mobile-first design
- Title font: SF Pro Expanded Black 36px, #1F1A0D

## How to Access
The summary page can be accessed in two ways:
1. From the main navigation menu via the "Summary" link
2. Directly through the `/summary` URL

## Data Processing
The summary feature processes messages as follows:
1. Retrieves up to 30 recent messages from Telegram
2. Groups them by chat
3. For each chat, shows the most recent message
4. For chats with multiple messages, adds numbering (up to 5)
5. Sorts all summaries by timestamp (newest first)
6. Limits the display to the 10 most recent chat summaries

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements for this feature:
- Toggle for showing only non-muted chats
- Custom theming options
- Preview of message media
- Action buttons (e.g., mark as read, reply)
- Option to adjust the number of messages shown
